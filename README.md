# 10alytics-Project-challenge



Welcome to my submission for the **10alytics Analytics Challenge** ‚Äî a hands-on data analytics project exploring real-world e-commerce data to generate business insights and actionable recommendations using Python, Dash, and visualization libraries.

---

##  Project Objectives

This project focused on solving business questions across four key pillars:

###  Customer Insights
- Analyzed purchasing behavior by city/state
- Identified retention vs. churn patterns
- Segmented customers by purchase frequency and order value

###  Sales Performance
- Ranked top product categories, sellers, and regions
- Explored revenue by payment methods
- Measured the impact of lead qualification on closed deals

###  Delivery & Logistics
- Compared estimated vs. actual delivery times
- Highlighted cities/states with frequent delivery delays

###  Review & Satisfaction
- Assessed review scores by product and seller
- Correlated long delivery times with lower review sentiment

##  Key Insights

##  Customer Behavior  
I observed that the majority of customers fall into the low-frequency, low-value segment. However, there's a small group of high-value customers that presents a major opportunity for retention and upselling.  
Also, S√£o Paulo (SP) stands out as the top region in both sales volume and delivery traffic.

---

## Sales & Product Performance  
I found that Health & Beauty, Watches & Gifts, and Bed & Bath are the leading product categories by revenue.  
Interestingly, a few top sellers generated the bulk of total sales ‚Äî a clear 80/20 pattern I couldn't ignore.

---

##  Payments & Revenue Streams  
It became evident that credit card payments dominate (over 75% of total revenue), while boleto remains significant for customers without access to cards.  
Other options like vouchers and debit cards showed minimal use.

---

##  Delivery & Logistics  
Most deliveries were either on-time or early, which is great ‚Äî but delays of over 20 days often led to lower customer reviews.  
I also noticed that SP and RJ consistently experienced the highest delivery delays, likely due to congestion and order volume.

---

##  Review Sentiment  
Review scores generally leaned toward 5 stars, which is great.  
However, I did spot low-score outliers (1‚Äì2 stars), often linked to delivery delays or product quality inconsistencies.

---

##  Sales Funnel Observations  
The conversion rate from qualified leads to closed deals stood at just ~10.5%.  
The top 3 sellers closed the majority of deals ‚Äî showing strong performance, but also hinting at opportunities to support and coach lower-performing sellers.

---

##  Recommendation

###  Boost Customer Retention  
Introduce loyalty programs and personalized marketing to engage low-frequency customers ‚Äî and increase their lifetime value.

###  Replicate What Works Among Top Sellers  
Study and share the sales techniques and strategies of high-performing sellers with the wider team.

###  Refine Regional Logistics  
Improve last-mile delivery operations in key regions like SP and RJ through better carrier partnerships and distribution optimization.

###  Communicate Proactively with Customers  
When delays happen, early communication, real-time tracking, and compensation (e.g., vouchers) can help maintain trust.

###  Tighten the Lead Qualification Process  
Revisit lead scoring logic and experiment with follow-up timing to increase closure rates.

###  Run Strategic A/B Tests  
Test different delivery messaging, review request timing, and discount visibility on product vs. checkout pages ‚Äî to optimize customer experience and conversion.
