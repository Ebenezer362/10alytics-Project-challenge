# 10alytics-Project-challenge



Welcome to my submission for the **10alytics Analytics Challenge** ‚Äî a hands-on data analytics project exploring real-world e-commerce data to generate business insights and actionable recommendations using Python, Dash, and visualization libraries.

---

##  Project Objectives

This project focused on solving business questions across four key pillars:

###  Customer Insights
- Analyzed purchasing behavior by city/state
- Identified retention vs. churn patterns
- Segmented customers by purchase frequency and order value

###  Sales Performance
- Ranked top product categories, sellers, and regions
- Explored revenue by payment methods
- Measured the impact of lead qualification on closed deals

###  Delivery & Logistics
- Compared estimated vs. actual delivery times
- Highlighted cities/states with frequent delivery delays

###  Review & Satisfaction
- Assessed review scores by product and seller
- Correlated long delivery times with lower review sentiment

---

##  Key Insights

- Most customers fall into the **low-frequency, low-value** segment, but a **high-value minority** offers major upsell potential
- **Health & Beauty**, **Watches & Gifts**, and **Bed & Bath** are the leading product categories by revenue
- **S√£o Paulo (SP)** dominates sales and delays ‚Äî both an opportunity and a logistics challenge
- **Credit cards** account for over 75% of revenue, followed by **boleto**
- Deliveries are mostly early or on time, but delays over **20+ days** strongly impact reviews
- Only **10.5%** of qualified leads convert, with the top 3 sellers closing most deals

---

##  Recommendations

-  **Boost customer retention** through loyalty programs and targeted promotions
-  **Replicate top-seller success** via strategy sharing and performance coaching
-  **Refine logistics in SP & RJ** using micro-fulfillment or improved courier partnerships
-  **Proactively communicate delays** with real-time updates and customer compensation
-  **Run A/B tests** on delivery messaging, review timing, and discount visibility
-  **Revisit lead scoring** and contact timing to improve conversion
